		<div>For a long while they studied the life forms of distant planets, and now it was time for them to go home.
</div>
		<div>START</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Dr.Croc and his companion Miss Bluebird are curious scientists, always zooming through space in search of interesting things.</div>
		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div>“I don’t know, but helmets on and brace yourself!” yelled Dr.Croc
</div>
		<div>When suddenly a loud BOOM echoed throughout the ship.

</div>
		<div>BACK
</div>
		<div>“What’s happening, Doc?!” screamed Miss Bluebird.
</div>
		<div>The two peeked out of the smoking ship, and both whispered “where on earth are we?"
</div>
		<div>With a ZOOM and WHAM, the ship crashed onto a tuft of grass. 

</div>
		<div>BACK</div>
		<div>“More importantly, we have to fix the ship!” said Dr.Croc, but that was no problem thanks to Miss Bluebird’s engineering skills!

</div>
		<div>The ship was fixed in no time, but the navigation system was completely kaput.

</div>
		<div>“I guess we’ll have to go out looking for help” answered Dr.Croc.
</div>
		<div>“Are you sure we’ll be able to go back home?” asked Miss Bluebird.
</div>
		<div>And so they wandered around this mysterious planet, looking for inhabitants who can help them out.
Out of nowhere, a peculiar creature suddenly popped out and asked, “Hello! What business do you have here?”

“AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!”

“Oh, sorry to startle you! I only wanted to offer some help!"
</div>
		<div>“But that is our only option” said Dr.Croc.
</div>
		<div>“That’s not very helpful” sighed Miss Bluebird.
</div>
		<div>"I see that you two are lost” said the mysterious creature. 
“Yes we are” answered Dr.Croc. “Do you know how to get to Earth?"

“Never heard of that one, but there are many planets surrounding this one. Perhaps you should travel to see if anyone has answers?"
</div>
		<div>The two thanked the mysterious plant creature and blasted off.

“Good luck finding Earth!” it yelled.</div>
		<div>And so began Dr.Croc and Miss Bluebird’s journey to find their way home.</div>
		<div>The two landed on a very grassy planet with a lovely sunset. 
“It doesn’t look like anyone’s here. Doc” said Miss Bluebird.
“There might be something, let’s go for a look” said Dr.Croc.
</div>
		<div>Little did they know that a gigantic whale-like creature was looming up behind them.

“AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!”

“PLEASE DON”T BE SCARED! I NEED YOUR HELP!!” it bellowed.

</div>
		<div>"Well I think I know someone who can help you” smiled Dr.Croc, looking at Miss Bluebird.
</div>
		<div>“MY TOOTH! IT HURTS! IT HURTS! PLEASE HELP ME!!!” it cried.
“I’VE BEEN EATING A LOT SWEETS AND NOW IT SUDDENLY HURTS!!”





</div>
		<div>“What? Who said I’ll help?” she shouted.
</div>
		<div>“PLEASE! IT HURTS!” bellowed the creature once more.
“Okay then, open your mouth wide” sighed Miss Bluebird.

With her dentistry skills, she fixed up the biggest cavity she has ever seen.

</div>
		<div>“OH, IT DOESN’T HURT ANYMORE! THANK YOU! I CAN EAT SWEETS AGAIN!”
Miss Bluebird sighed again. “You sure can, but make sure you take care of your teeth.”
“Well done Miss Bluebird!” Dr.Croc smiled.
</div>
		<div>“THANK YOU SO MUCH, HOW CAN I RETURN THE FAVOUR?” said the creature.
</div>
		<div>“EARTH? NEVER HEARD OF IT. BUT YOU CAN TRY ASKING THE INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET NEXT TO THIS ONE."</div>
		<div>“Maybe you can tell us what you know about Earth?” answered Miss Bluebird.</div>
		<div>The two thanked the creature and blasted off.</div>
		<div>And so they continued on with their journey to find their way home.</div>
		<div>They arrived on a barren planet with low mountains and nothing else.
As they got ready to get off the ship, they noticed a dinosaur-like creature running towards them looking awfully worried.

“HELP!” it shouted. “My tail’s ran off!"
</div>
		<div>“Your tail ran off?” asked Dr.Croc.

“It did! It did! We had a fight and it popped off. My tail can’t live without me and I can’t live without it!"
</div>
		<div>“It’s crawled into a hole and I can show you where it is. Can you please help me?” the creature pleaded.

Dr.Croc looked at Miss Bluebird again, receiving a sigh.
</div>
		<div>“Why do I have to do everything around here” murmured Miss Bluebird as she crawled through the narrow tunnel. 
As she moved a little further she spotted a spaghetti-like silhouette curled up in the corner.
“I’M NOT GOING BACK!” it yelled.
“Do you care about your pal?” Miss Bluebird asked.
“NO!” it hissed.

</div>
		<div>After a long pause, the tail finally spoke up. “I guess I was being immature. I know it cares about me but I get too stubborn. I’ll come out now."</div>
		<div>“Well it cares a lot about you. I don’t know what sort of argument you had, but it really wants you to come back. If you don’t it’ll die and so will you!"
</div>
		<div>Miss Bluebird and the tail crawled out of the hole together.
The moment the creature and its tail saw each other, their faces beamed with happiness.
“I’m sorry I was stubborn!” said the tail.
“And I’m sorry I was being difficult!” said the creature.

“Well done Miss Bluebird!” Dr.Croc smiled again. ”You helped not one but two creatures in need."
</div>
		<div>“Thank you so much!” said the two. “Is there anything we can do for you?"</div>
		<div>Dr.Croc and Miss Bluebird said thanks anyway, and blasted off.
</div>
		<div>“Hmm, we have no idea. Maybe try asking neighbouring planets. Sorry we couldn’t be much of a help. Good luck finding it though.” they frowned.</div>
		<div>“Do you know how to get to Earth?” asked Dr.Croc.</div>
		<div>They arrived on a rather small planet, strangely isolated from the nearby ones.
The moment they stepped foot, a gigantic hand landed right in front of them with a loud THUMP.
“GET THESE OFF ME” bellowed a low voice.
</div>
		<div>Looking down at them was a giant with magnificent gems covering its body.

“Get them off? But they’re beautiful!” said Dr.Croc.

“No they aren’t! Everyone has smooth bodies, but I’m the only freak with these gems! No one wants to be friends with me! I don’t have any friends!” it yelled angrily.

“Okay then, we’ll help you”
said Dr.Croc.

As his hands reached one of the gems, Miss Bluebird shouted “NO!"
</div>
		<div>“Then where will I find these friends who will accept me?” asked the giant.
</div>
		<div>“I used to be made fun of because my back is blue instead of grey! I’m an Egyptian Plover but my name is Miss Bluebird! I didn’t care if my fellow birds didn’t want to be my friend because I was different. I found my own friends who accept me as who I am!”ranted Miss Bluebird.

</div>
		<div>“Right here!!” said a collection of small voices.</div>
		<div>“Of course you can!” replied the giant, crying happy mineral tears.
“Thank you Miss Bluebird, I finally have friends!"
</div>
		<div>The giant couldn’t believe it. The gems were alive!
“We’ve always wanted to be your friend. but we were afraid of talking to you because you always wished us away. Can we be your friends?” they asked.
</div>
		<div>“Well done Miss Bluebird!” smiled Dr.Croc as always.
</div>
		<div>“Don’t mention it,” said Miss Bluebird “but perhaps you can tell us if you know anything about Earth?"
</div>
		<div>“I don’t even know how to express my gratitude” said the giant.

</div>
		<div>The two said thanks to the giant and blasted off.</div>
		<div>“I never heard of that planet before,” answered the giant “but I heard rumors of a creature living in a nearby planet who knows all about the universe. Maybe they can help you."</div>
		<div>And so they continued on with their journey to find their way home. </div>
		<div>They arrived on a bright coloured planet with spiky rocks that looked like it could not accommodate any living creature. 

“There’s nothing here!” yelled Miss Bluebird. “That giant lied!”
“Now now, we might be able to find someone” said Dr.Croc.
“I don’t want to do this anymore, Doc! We’re lost! We’ll never be able to go back home!” cried Miss Bluebird, and flew away.
</div>
		<div>“But everything was for a purpose. You’re not aimlessly wandering around” said a mysterious voice.</div>
		<div>Miss Bluebird sat on the tip of a rock and sobbed into her wings.
“I just want to go home! I’m sick of wandering around!"</div>
		<div>She looked back to see a dragon-like creature smiling at her.
“Look how far you’ve come” it said.
</div>
		<div>Letting out a belch, the creature squeezed up its light and projected a map of the universe. Earth was only a couple of planets away!
</div>
		<div>“See, you shouldn’t lose hope now. You’ve come such a long way, you can’t just give it up like that!"</div>
		<div>Immediately, Miss Bluebird said “I have to find Doc and apologise!”
They flew across the planet, spotting a lonely Dr.Croc walking down a path.
</div>
		<div>“Nothing to worry about Miss Bluebird,” smiled Dr.Croc. “You are one strong bird and I’m very proud of having you on this journey.</div>
		<div>Miss Bluebird swooped down and hugged him.
“I’m sorry for yelling at you!
</div>
		<div>“Thank you so much dragon, or whatever you are!” said said Miss Bluebird cheerfully. "I haven’t realised how much I learned from this journey. I’ve seen so many things that I never would have if I gave up."</div>
		<div>The creature laughed. “That’s quite alright. Just remember that there will always be a way for anything.”

From the bottom of their hearts, the two said thanks and blasted off.
</div>
		<div>“We’ll be making our way home now,” said Dr.Croc. “I don’t know how to thank you."</div>
		<div>And so their journey to find their way home was coming to an end.</div>
		<div>They took detours from mystic lakes...</div>
		<div>…to enchanted forests.</div>
		<div>Because they knew they were going home.</div>
		<div>“Are you ready for another detour?” asked Dr.Croc.
Miss Bluebird smiled, “Ready when you are Doc."
